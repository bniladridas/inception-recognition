# Object Recognition with InceptionV3

## Overview
This project implements object recognition using the InceptionV3 deep learning model. The model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, making it capable of accurately classifying a wide range of objects in images.

## Features
- InceptionV3 architecture for powerful image classification
- Pre-trained weights on ImageNet for quick deployment
- Easy-to-use Python script for testing on custom images
- Ideal for learning about deep learning and image classification

## Example Results
### Here are some example results obtained using the InceptionV3 model:
Predictions:
- 1: freight_car (0.85)
- 2: electric_locomotive (0.08)
- 3: passenger_car (0.01)

## Install the required dependencies:
`pip install tensorflow`
